This app approximates how long it takes until you can legally drive after consuming alcohol, giving a definitive answer to the age-old question of "Can I Drive?".

I decided to develop it when one of my friends wanted to drive home after drinking a beer. I had gotten tired of using rough approximations, and figured an app would be the perfect solution.
